# A Machine-Learning Project
This goal of this project is to predict citation of a paper based on different features.

This project uses a dblp dataset, and creates a deep learning algorithm to convert title and abstract of a paper to a 32 feature vector.

Also for prediction, other features such as author, publication venue, and year are used.

Part of the code for this project is shown here (the parser and Multi-Layer Preceptron Neural Network) alongside with some tests for parser (which uses gensym to vectorize the words and documents).
